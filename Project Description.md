# Combined Power Plant Energy Prediction using Artificial Neural Network [90% R2_Score]
### 

The "Website-Phishing Classification" project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify websites as either legitimate or phishing based on various features extracted from the website's characteristics. The project utilizes a dataset containing labeled examples of legitimate and phishing websites, and employs machine learning techniques to build a predictive model.
Used Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression and computed the accuracy, f1-score and classification report.

[UCML Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/294/combined+cycle+power+plant)
#### The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP)  of the plant.
A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is colected from and has effect on the Steam Turbine, he other three of the ambient variables effect the GT performance.


## Libraries Used
Used Python as programming language
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Tensorlow
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Buidling Artificial Neural Network
- Creating a sequential neural network as problem is simple regression.<br>
  Adding 2 hidden layers (fully connected)

  ```
    ann.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=6, activation='relu'))
    ann.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=6, activation='relu'))
    ann.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1))

    ann.compile(optimizer='adam',loss='mean_squared_error')
    ann.fit(X_train,y_train,epochs=100,batch_size = 32)
  ```

*   **Activation Function** = ReLU Activation Function<br>
    ReLU : Rectified Linear Activation Function, which adds non-linearity to the model to learn complex relations.
    f(x) = max(0,x)

*   **Units** = 6 (no of neuron units in each layer)
*   Basic Regression model using Artificial Neural Network


## Results
    Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 4.1
    Mean Squared Error (MSE): 28.3
    Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 5.3
    Coefficient of Determination (R^2) (%): 90.3
